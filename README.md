## OBJECTIVE OF OUR APPLIATION
<p>
Using CPP to create a software where anybody else can generate your password, a really secure one.
On this project we're working with classes and some libraries.
Our app will run only on the console, nonetheless the user who is interacting with, can say to the computer
how much letter should have the password, once it show the password, it'll be saved in a object array,
on cause of the user desire to see again the password. 

````NOTE: THAT CASE OF SEEING AGAIN THE PASSWORD IS JUST A STEP ON THE FUTURE````

A function to display a what that password will have;
CHARS of characters that our password will have;
AND STILL WORDKING ON THE CLASS;

``SOON THAT CLASS WILL BE ON ANOTHER CPP FILE TO MINIMEZ OUR CODE AND SMOOTH OUR REFACTORATION``
